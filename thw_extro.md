# As compared to

> New function interfaces undergo a rigorous design process that typically
> involves dozens to hundreds of developer-hours per function.

> MATLAB toolboxes offer professionally developed, rigorously tested,
> field-hardened, and fully documented functionality for scientific and
> engineering applications.

> MathWorks has over 250 full-time quality and test engineers who validate
> product quality and accuracy, and ensure the software passes extensive test
> suites before being released.

# Passion

> I want to assume that we do this from love, that we care about each other,
> and that we welcome the crackle of real passion, real work, the real
> interaction of ideas. [Ron Jeffries: Passion](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/jatpassion)

# On culture

> I came to see, in my time at IBM, that culture isn't just one aspect of the
> game - it is the game (Louis V Gerstner, "Who says elephants can't dance?"
> p182)

# High-performance teams

> [High-performance teams] achieve beyond any measure of reasonableness, and
> they have fun doing it.  The finely developed sense of humor in these groups
> seems to distinguish them as well.  Not everything they do is laced with fun,
> and there may be some humorless high-performance teams out there.  But we
> doubt it. ("The wisdom of teams" by Jon R. Katzenbach and Douglas K. Smith).

# A view from over the hill

Find:

* Absurd ambition
* Persistence
* Enthusiasm
* Courage
* Friendship

wherever you can. Then go and work with those people. Move if you have to.

# What should we do?

How can we foster these virtues in our University?

# The Hacker Within

What next?

# Is this the end of the talk?

Yes, it is the end of the talk.
